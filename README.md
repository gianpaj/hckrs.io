=========

[**hckrs.io**](http://hckrs.io) is an invite only platform for hackers; for basicly anyone who has to make stuff, somehow related to technology. ***#web #design #growth #hardware #life...***
[**Join your local city**](http://hckrs.io) to see it in action. *(Europe only for now)*

[ [Live Demo](http://hckrs.io) ]

The project is completely **open source**, meaning that you will have full insight on the development progress and are very welcome to contribute. Together we can build better **tools for local ecosystems**, for hackers at least ;)

######2. Go to the ***hckrs*** folder in your terminal.

*Meteor has no solid support for windows yet.*




Roadmap
--------

* Subcultures with meetups
* Gather interests — based on the Stack Overflow tags
* Go mobile — a hybrid application


**Parallel things we need help with**

* Build a CalDAV / CardDAV server per city
* Aggregation of different agenda feeds into a single one
* Building a social invite plugin
* Integrating http://telescope.meteor.com/
* Finding parners that want to give discounts to hackers.

Getting involved?
------------------

No need to be a developer to contribute. We have ambitous plans that require all kinds of skills, you may be good in ***video, story telling, copywriting, blogging, interviewing/podcasting, mobile apps, events, curation, hackatons, recruitment***.

We are looking for people that make things happen. (**BAM!**)

It's also okay to just start developing (making changes to this repo). Feel free to work on issues or add your own. Do a pull request when you are done.

**GO!**

You can also contact toon@hckrs.io, or take a look in the *parallel things we need help with* section above.


Local Admins
------------

Because each city has it's own identity, they are led by local admins.

**These local admins need to :**

* activate signups with a hacker profile
* reply to local email

**and sometimes go the extra mile :**

* plan the monthly hckrs meetup (BEER + GEEKS = ♥ MEETUP)
* manage local Twitter account

**Want to found your city?**

Wow, that's awesome, lets kickstart your city, get in touch with toon@hckrs.io
